# Week 1
- Referencing images in sass: start with `/`, don't reference `img` folder, and place in `public/` that's sibling to `src`
- Icons with `react-icons`
- In-depth post: Auth with Supabase
  - Need to attach email. Google Workspace may be best to test with; Sendgrid and Resend have usable hobby plans
  - Gracefully handling all errors that can arise in server action
  - Async xhr for checking username availability
